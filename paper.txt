ABSTRACT
Rapid urbanization and car-centric planning have led to cities where essential services
are often beyond walking distance for many residents. The ”15-Minute City” concept
proposes a solution where daily needs are accessible within a short walk or bike
ride. This project presents a computational framework to support this concept by
optimizing the placement of new amenities to maximize city-wide walkability. Using
OpenStreetMap data, we construct a pedestrian network graph for the city of Balıkesir.
We implement a ”WalkScore” based metric to quantify accessibility and use a Greedy
algorithm to identify optimal locations for new facilities such as grocery stores and
schools. Our experiments demonstrate that data-driven optimization can significantly
improve the average WalkScore and reduce walking distances for residents, providing a
valuable tool for urban planners aiming to create more sustainable and equitable cities.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Problem Definition
Rapid urbanization has led to significant challenges in modern cities, including
increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and reduced quality of life. Traditional
urban planning often prioritizes automobile travel, leading to sprawling developments
where essential services are not within walking distance for many residents. This
car dependency not only contributes to environmental degradation but also negatively
impacts public health by discouraging active transportation modes like walking and
cycling. The lack of accessible amenities such as grocery stores, schools, and parks
in close proximity to residential areas creates spatial inequality and reduces social
interaction within communities.

1.2. Motivation
The ”15-Minute City” concept has emerged as a promising solution to these
challenges. It proposes a urban planning model where all residents can access their
daily needs—living, working, supplying, caring, learning, and enjoying—within a 15minute walk or bike ride from their homes. This project is motivated by the potential
of this concept to create more sustainable, equitable, and healthy cities. Improving
walkability not only reduces carbon emissions but also fosters local economies and
enhances the overall well-being of urban populations.

1.3. Scope and Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a computational framework
for optimizing the placement of new amenities to improve walkability in urban areas.
The specific objectives are:
• To analyze the current walkability status of a selected urban region using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.
• To implement and compare optimization algorithms, specifically a Greedy Heuristic approach, for determining the optimal locations for new amenities.
• To maximize the average ”WalkScore” of the region and minimize the walking
1

distances for residents.
• To conduct a case study on the city of Balıkesir, Turkey, to demonstrate the
practical application of the proposed framework.

1.4. Thesis Organization
The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:
• Chapter 2 provides the background and literature review, discussing the 15Minute City concept, walkability metrics, and related facility location problems.
• Chapter 3 details the methodology, including the problem formulation, data
collection, network construction, and the design of the optimization algorithms.
• Chapter 4 describes the system implementation, covering the system architecture, technology stack, and the software modules developed.
• Chapter 5 presents the experimental setup, the case study of Balıkesir, and the
analysis of the optimization results.
• Chapter 6 summarizes the contributions, discusses limitations, and outlines
directions for future work.

2. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. The 15-Minute City Concept
The 15-Minute City is an urban design approach that aims to improve quality
of life by creating cities where everything a resident needs can be reached within a
quarter of an hour by foot or bike. The concept, popularized by Carlos Moreno, emphasizes decentralization and a mix of uses to ensure that neighborhoods are complete
and self-sufficient. This model promotes a shift away from car-centric planning towards a human-centric approach, fostering stronger community bonds and reducing the
environmental footprint of cities.

2.2. Walkability Metrics
Quantifying walkability is essential for analyzing and improving urban environments. Various metrics exist, but ”WalkScore” is one of the most widely used and
recognized.

2.2.1. WalkScore Methodology
WalkScore calculates a score between 0 and 100 for any location based on its
distance to nearby amenities. Points are awarded based on the distance to amenities
in categories such as grocery, restaurants, healthcare, and schools. Amenities within
a 5-minute walk (approximately 400 meters) receive maximum points, while a decay
function reduces the points as the distance increases, reaching zero at a 30-minute walk.

2.2.2. Distance Decay Functions
To model pedestrian behavior realistically, distance decay functions are used.
These functions represent the probability of a person walking to a destination as the
distance increases. Common forms include linear, exponential, and inverse power
functions. In this project, we adopt a decay function aligned with the WalkScore
methodology to accurately assessing accessibility.

3

2.3. Facility Location Problems
The problem of placing amenities to maximize accessibility falls under the
broader category of Facility Location Problems (FLP) in operations research.

2.3.1. Classic Approaches
Classic approaches include the k-median problem and the k-center problem. The
k-median problem seeks to minimize the total weighted distance between demand points
and the nearest facility, while the k-center problem aims to minimize the maximum
distance.

2.3.2. Optimization Techniques
Various optimization techniques, ranging from exact methods like Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) to heuristic and meta-heuristic anlgorithms, are used to
solve these problems. Given the NP-hard nature of many facility location variants,
heuristics like the Greedy algorithm are often preferred for large-scale urban instances
to obtain good solutions within reasonable time frames.

3. METHODOLOGY
3.1. Problem Formulation
The core problem is defined as selecting a set of locations from candidate sites
to establish new amenities (of types such as grocery, pharmacy, school) such that the
average walkability score of the residential population is maximized.

3.1.1. Objective Function
The objective function is to maximize:
Maximize Z =

X

Pi × Si (Aexisting ∪ Anew )

(3.1)

i∈R

Where:
• R is the set of residential nodes.
• Pi is the population weight at node i.
• Si is the WalkScore function calculated based on distances to amenities.
• Aexisting is the set of existing amenities.
• Anew is the set of newly placed amenities.

3.1.2. Constraints
The optimization is subject to constraints such as:
• The total number of new amenities is limited by a budget k.
• New amenities can only be placed at designated candidate locations (e.g., vacant
lots, parking areas).
• Capacity constraints of candidate locations.

5

3.2. Data Collection and Preparation
3.2.1. Data Source: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
We utilize OpenStreetMap (OSM) as the primary data source. OSM provides
rich geospatial data including street networks, building footprints, and points of interest
(POIs).

3.2.2. Region of Interest: Balıkesir
The focus area is the city center of Balıkesir. We extract the bounding box
coordinates for the region and download the relevant map data.

3.2.3. Data Processing
The raw OSM data is processed to extract:
• Street Network: Edges and nodes representing the walkable paths.
• Amenities: Current locations of essential services classified by type (e.g., sustenance, education, healthcare).
• Residential Points: Centroids of residential buildings are used as demand points.

3.3. Network Construction
A pedestrian graph G = (V, E) is constructed where V represents intersections
or points of interest and E represents walkable street segments.

3.3.1. Graph Building
Using the ‘osmnx‘ library, we create a network graph specifically for the ‘walk‘
mode. This ensures that highways and non-pedestrian roads are excluded.

3.3.2. Shortest Path Calculations
Walking distances are not Euclidean; they must follow the street network. We
calculate the shortest path distances between all residential nodes and amenity nodes
6

using Dijkstra’s algorithm. For efficiency in large networks, we may compute and store
these distances in a matrix.

3.4. Scoring Mechanism
The scoring mechanism is adapted from the standard WalkScore algorithm.

3.4.1. Distance Decay
We apply a piecewise linear decay function. Amenities within a short walk (e.g.,
5 minutes) contribute full points. As distance increases, the points decay, reaching zero
at a cutoff threshold (e.g., 30 minutes).

3.4.2. Weighted Aggregation
Different amenity types have different weights reflecting their importance (e.g.,
a grocery store might have a higher weight than a coffee shop). The final score for a
residence is a weighted sum of the scores for each amenity category.

3.5. Optimization Algorithms
Given that the facility location problem is NP-hard, finding an exact solution for
a large city network is computationally prohibitive.

3.5.1. Greedy Heuristic
We implement a Greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the best location. The
algorithm calculates the marginal gain in the global WalkScore for each potential
candidate location and picks the one that offers the highest immediate improvement.
This process is repeated until k amenities are placed.

4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
4.1. System Architecture
The system architecture follows a modular design, separating data processing,
core logic, and presentation layers.
1. Data Layer: Handles the retrieval and storage of geospatial data from OpenStreetMap. It manages the local database (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of
network graphs and amenity locations.
2. Logic Layer: Contains the core algorithms for network construction, shortest
path calculation, and optimization. This layer interacts with the data layer to
fetch necessary inputs and processes them to generate optimization results.
3. Presentation Layer: Responsible for visualizing the results. It generates maps
and statistical summaries to present the current walkability status and the proposed improvements.

4.2. Technology Stack
The implementation relies on a robust stack of open-source technologies:
• Programming Language: Python 3.9+ is used for its extensive support for data
science and geospatial libraries.
• Database: PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension is used for efficient storage
and querying of spatial data.
• Key Libraries:
– OSMnx: For downloading and modeling street networks from OpenStreetMap.
– NetworkX: For graph algorithms and shortest path computations.
– Shapely GeoPandas: For geometric operations and handling spatial dataframes.
– Folium: For generating interactive map visualizations.

9

4.3. Software Modules
The codebase is organized into several key modules, each addressing a specific
aspect of the Walkability Optimization problem.

4.3.1. osm loader
This module handles the interface with the OpenStreetMap API. It allows for
specifying a city or a bounding box and downloading the corresponding street network
and points of interest (POIs). It filters the raw data to retain only relevant amenities
such as supermarkets, restaurants, and schools.

4.3.2. pedestrian graph
This module is responsible for constructing the graph representation of the city.
It processes the raw OSM data to create a graph where nodes represent intersections or
locations, and edges represent walkable paths. It ensures that the graph is connected
and valid for routing.

4.3.3. shortest paths
This module implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path distances between any two nodes in the graph. To optimize performance for repeated
queries during the optimization phase, it can pre-compute a distance matrix for critical
node pairs (e.g., all residential nodes to all candidate amenity nodes).

4.3.4. walkscore
This core module calculates the WalkScore for a given location. It implements
the distance decay logic, taking the distances computed by the ‘shortest paths‘ module
and applying the decay function. It aggregates the scores from different amenity types
based on predefined weights.

4.3.5. greedy optimization
This module enables the optimization logic described in Chapter 3. It takes the
current state of the network, a set of candidate locations, and a budget k as inputs. It

10

iteratively runs the greedy heuristic to identify the best set of new amenity locations
that maximize the average WalkScore.

4.4. User Interface
Currently, the user interface consists of generated HTML maps using the Folium
library. These interactive maps allow users to visualize:
• The street network and existing amenities.
• Heatmaps representing the distribution of WalkScores across the city.
• The locations selected by the optimization algorithm for new amenities.
Future work may involve developing a dedicated web or desktop application for more
dynamic interaction.

11

5. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
5.1. Experimental Setup
The experiments were conducted on a standard workstation equipped with an
Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. The software environment was set up on
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) running Ubuntu 20.04. The primary metric for
evaluation is the average WalkScore of all residential nodes in the selected region. We
tested various scenarios by changing the number of new amenities (k) to be placed.

5.2. Case Study: Balıkesir
The central district of Balıkesir, Turkey, was selected as the case study area.

5.2.1. Current State Analysis
Before optimization, we analyzed the existing walkability of the city center. The
baseline analysis revealed that while the immediate city center has high walkability,
peripheral residential areas suffer from a lack of accessible amenities within a 15minute walking distance. The initial average WalkScore was calculated to establish a
baseline for comparison.

5.2.2. Candidate Locations
Potential locations for new amenities were identified based on vacant lots and
parking areas extracted from OpenStreetMap. These locations served as the search
space for the optimization algorithm.

5.3. Optimization Results
We ran the Greedy optimization algorithm for different values of k (e.g., k =
1, 3, 5).

12

5.3.1. WalkScore Improvement
The results show a clear improvement in the average WalkScore as k increases.
For example, placing just 3 strategically located amenities resulted in a noticeable
increase in the city-wide average score. The algorithm prioritized placing amenities in
”food deserts”—areas with high population density but low access to grocery stores.

5.3.2. Distance Reduction
The optimization also significantly reduced the average walking distance for
residents to the nearest amenity. This reduction directly contributes to the ”15-Minute
City” goal, bringing more residents within the 15-minute isochrone of essential services.

5.4. Visual Analysis
5.4.1. Heatmaps
We generated heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution of walkability. Figure

Figure 5.1: WalkScore Heatmap Before Optimization

5.1 shows the initial state, where red areas indicate low walkability.

Figure 5.2: WalkScore Heatmap After Optimization (k=5)

Figure 5.2 demonstares the effect of the optimization. We can observe the
expansion of high-walkability (green/blue) zones into previously underserved areas.

5.4.2. Selected Locations
The algorithm successfully identified optimal locations that cover the maximum
number of previously underserved residents. Maps showing these specific points allow
urban planners to validate the algorithm’s suggestions against real-world constraints.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
6.1. Summary of Contributions
In this thesis, we presented a computational framework for ”Walkability Optimization for 15-Minute Cities”. We successfully:
• Developed a pipeline to fetch and process urban data from OpenStreetMap.
• Constructed a walkable network graph and implemented a WalkScore-based
scoring mechanism.
• Implemented a Greedy heuristic algorithm to optimize the placement of new
amenities.
• Applied this framework to a case study in Balıkesir, demonstrating that datadriven planning can significantly improve urban accessibility.
Our results highlight that even modest interventions, when optimized, can have a
profound impact on the quality of life for residents.

6.2. Limitations
While promising, the study has limitations:
• Data Quality: The accuracy of the results depends heavily on the completeness
of OpenStreetMap data. Missing amenities or incorrect road tags can skew the
analysis.
• Simplified Model: The current model assumes all residents have equal mobility
and does not account for topography (hills) or other barriers to walking beyond
network distance.
• Computational Complexity: While the Greedy algorithm is efficient, calculating exact shortest paths for very large networks remains computationally intensive.

6.3. Future Work
Future research directions include:
14

• Multi-Objective Optimization: Incorporating other factors such as cost of land,
zoning regulations, and specific community needs into the objective function.
• Advanced Algorithms: exploring meta-heuristics like Genetic Algorithms or
Simulated Annealing to potentially find better solutions than the Greedy approach.
• Real-Time Interaction: Creating a web-based tool that allows urban planners
to interactively place amenities and see the WalkScore update in real-time.
• Broader Application: Extending the case study to other cities and comparing
the results to identify common urban planning patterns.
